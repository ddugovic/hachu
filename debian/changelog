hachu (0.16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial release, from source sent by upstream via email.
  * Set VERSION to just "0.16" as discussed with upstream.
  * Upload to experimental because of an apparent misunderstanding about
    shogi with xboard, works well as Chess engine in xboard at least.
